## Doggo Discord bot

You can invoke the bot to send [random dog pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogpictures) on demand using ```!woof``` while running ```app.py``` in the background. This can be changed by altering the conditional statement:

```python
if message.content.startswith('!woof'):
```
